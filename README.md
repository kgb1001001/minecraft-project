# minecraft-project
This project accompanies the (planned) article series on running Minecraft in Docker and
writing Minecraft plugins to integrate with IBM Bluemix. 
The changes in this forked repository are to support the deprecation and replacement of   
the Watson Dialog service with Watson Conversation service.
